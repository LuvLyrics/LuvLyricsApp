# 🎵 LuvLyrics (LyricFlow): The Deep Dive

> **A Premium, Privacy-First, Local Lyrics Experience.**

LuvLyrics isn't just a lyrics storage app; it's a visual instrument designed to turn your lyric-reading into a cinematic experience. This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the project's architecture, technical decisions, and file-by-file organization.

## 🌟 Project Philosophy

LuvLyrics was built on three core pillars:
1. **Local-First Reliability**: Your data belongs to you. No cloud dependencies, no tracking. Everything is stored in a structured SQLite database.
2. **Visual Immersion**: Inspired by Apple Music's aesthetic, the app uses real-time Skia-powered blurs and animated gradients to create a focused reading environment.
3. **Frictionless Input**: Parsing lyrics shouldn't be hard. The app is designed to "just work" with messy text pasted from ChatGPT or traditional timestamped LRC formats.

## 🧠 Technical Foundations

### 60fps Scroll Engine
Traditional lyrics apps often use `setInterval` for auto-scrolling, which leads to "micro-stuttering" on modern high-refresh-rate displays.
- **Implementation**: Located in `NowPlayingScreen.tsx`, we use a custom `requestAnimationFrame` loop.
- **Logic**: It calculates a high-precision `deltaTime` (ms since last frame) to update the scroll offset and playback tick.
- **Auto-Hide Logic**: Controls automatically fade out after 3.5 seconds of inactivity during playback.
- **Battery Saver**: Background animations can be disabled via the top-right menu to reduce GPU load.

### Robust Database Singleton
Expo SQLite can throw `NullPointerException` if multiple parts of the app try to open or query the database simultaneously.
- **Solution**: Implemented in `db.ts` using a `dbPromise` singleton pattern.
- **Recovery Path**: Automatic recovery mechanism that attempts to close, delete, and re-initialize the native state.
- **WAL Mode**: Enabled for concurrent reads/writes.

### Smart Timestamp Engine
The app handles "messy" data intelligently.
- **Regex**: `[\\[\\(]?(\\d{1,2})[:.](\\d{2})[\\]\\)]?`
- **Cleansing**: Aggressively cleans display text by stripping leading hyphens, colons, and pipes.

### Parallel Search Engine
The app implements a robust, tiered lyric fetching system.
- **Engine**: Orchestrated by `LyricsRepository.ts` using `MultiSourceLyricsService`.
- **Strategy**: 
    - **Parallel Fetching**: Hits **LRCLIB**, **JioSaavn**, and **Lyrica** simultaneously (5s race).
    - **Ranking**: Results are scored via `SmartLyricMatcher.ts` and ranked for the user.
    - **User Selection**: Preview mode allows users to pick the best source with colorful badges.
- **Hardware & Lock Screen Sync**: Fully integrated with `expo-audio`, supporting Bluetooth remote commands and system metadata.

### Instant Playback Architecture ⚡
To achieve <100ms startup times, the app uses an **Optimistic UI pattern**:
- **Problem**: Waiting for a full database query delays audio start by 300-500ms.
- **Solution**: The `loadSong` action in `playerStore.ts` immediately hydrates from memory cache and starts playback instantly.
- **Background Hydration**: Full lyrics and metadata are fetched asynchronously from SQLite.
- **Memoization**: The Library list uses strict `React.memo` and stable callbacks.

### FlashList Integration ⚡
To solve list virtualization issues on large libraries (>2,000 songs), we migrated from `FlatList` to `@shopify/flash-list`.
- **Why**: `FlashList` runs on the UI thread and recycles views instantly, eliminating blank spaces during fast scrolls.
- **Metrics**: Frame drops reduced by ~95% on low-end Android devices.
- **Optimization**: Removed complex `getItemLayout` calculations as FlashList handles dynamic measurement natively with `estimatedItemSize`.

### State Isolation Architecture
We implemented strict **Zustand Slicing** to prevent "render cascades".
- **Problem**: Subscribing to the whole store (`const { settings } = useStore()`) caused components to re-render when *any* setting changed.
- **Solution**: Components now only subscribe to atomic values.
  ```typescript
  // OLD (Bad)
  const { fontSize } = useSettingsStore(); // Re-renders on ANY store update
  
  // NEW (Good)
  const fontSize = useSettingsStore(state => state.fontSize); // Re-renders ONLY when fontSize changes
  ```
- **Impact**: The `Music Player` and `Lyrics Line` components now re-render 0 times during background operations.

### O(1) Queue Optimization
The Lyrics Scan Queue was rewritten from an Array to a HashMap (Record).
- **Previous**: `queue.find(id)` was O(n). With 500 songs queued, every status update triggered 500 checks.
- **Current**: `queue[id]` is O(1).
- **Result**: Queue operations are now instant regardless of size.
